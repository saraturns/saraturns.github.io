		<h3>Blueberry Cardamom Muffins</h3>

		
		<p>Yield: 12 muffins</p>

		<p>Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a standard 12-muffin pan or line with paper cups.</p>

		<h4>Whisk together in a large bowl:</h4>
		<p>2 cups all-purpose flour
		<br>1 tablespoon baking powder
		<br>1/2 teaspoon salt
		<br>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</p>

		<h4>Whisk together in another bowl:</h4>
		<p>2 large eggs
		<br>1 cup whole milk
		<br>2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
		<br>8 tablespoons (1 stick) warm melted salted butter
		<br>1 teaspoon vanilla</p>

		<p>Add to the flour and stir until just combined. Add 1 1/2 cups frozen blueberries and divide batter among muffin cups. Sprinkle each one generously with granulated sugar  and a pinch of cardamom (or more to taste). Bake 16-18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in  the center. The tops will be golden, crispy and sweet. Serve as soon as possible.</p>
